<p>So I am grading intro algebra exams, and there is this problem:</p>
<p><em>The product of two consecutive positive even integers in 168. Find the integers.</em></p>
<p>Students are supposed to solve this by setting up and solving a quadratic equation <span class="math inline">\(x(x+2) = 168\)</span>. Whatâ€™s stupid about this is that at this moment the only way to solve this equation that the students know is simple factoring, so they have to rewrite the equation as <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + 2x - 168 = 0\)</span> and factor it. In order to factor this, they need to find two numbers whose difference is 2 and whose product is 168. In other words, they have to solve the original question.</p>
<p>Of course, should they know how to complete a square, they could instead rewrite the equation as <span class="math inline">\((x+1)^2 - 169 = 0\)</span>. The left side is now a difference of two squares, so itcan be factored as <span class="math inline">\((x + 1 + 13)(x + 1 - 13)\)</span>. Now we can start asking more interesting questions, for example <em>which numbers can be written as a product of two consecutive even or odd integers?</em></p>
