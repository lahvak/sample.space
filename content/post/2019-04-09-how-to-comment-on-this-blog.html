<p>This blog uses <a href="https://utterance.es/">utterance.es</a> to enable commenting on posts.
<em>Utterances</em> use GitHub <em>issues</em> to keep track of commens. Basically the way it works is, when you comment, an
<em>issue</em> will be created on GitHub with your comment. <em>Utterances</em> then finds all issues
related to a post, and displays them as comments at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>This makes it easy for me, because all your comments are available to me on GitHub, where I can easily access and manage them.</p>
<div id="what-it-means-for-you" class="section level2">
<h2>What it means for you</h2>
<p>To post a comment to a post on this blog, you need to make sure that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>you have a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account, and</li>
<li>you do not block third party cookies from <code>utteranc.es</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find out that you cannot post a comment even after logging into your GitHub account, it probably means that your browser blocks third party cookies. In most browsers, even if you block third party cookies, you can add exceptions for individual sites. To be able to comment on this site, you need to allow cookies from <code>utteranc.es</code>.</p>
