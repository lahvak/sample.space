<p>In the <a href="https://space.lahvak.space/2019/04/14/tidyverse-rows-as-vectors/">last post</a> I complained that
there is no way to apply a formula to rows of a data frame so that the formula
will consume the rows as lists or vectors. Turns out I was wrong, and there is
a very easy way to do it!</p>
<p>Not only that, but I was actually really close to it, and if I was just reading
<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.3/topics/dots">the relevant documentation</a>
bit more carefully…</p>
<p>As I wrote in that post, this works:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = pmap_dbl(., ~sum((c(..1, ..2, ..3, ..4) -
                                 expected)^2/expected))) %&gt;%
    head()</code></pre>
<p>I was suggesting that perhaps something like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmap_dbl(selections, ~sum((.row - expected)^2/expected))</code></pre>
<p>would be nice to have. While experimenting, among other things I tries this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmap_dbl(selections, ~sum((... - expected)^2/expected))</code></pre>
<p>which of course does not work, and I am not sure why I thought it would. The
correct way, of course, is</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmap_dbl(selections, ~sum((c(...) - expected)^2/expected))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>...</code> is, in this case, equivalent to <code>..1, ..2, ..3, ..4</code>.
Since I need <code>c(..1, ..2, ..3, ..4)</code>, I have to use <code>c(...)</code>.</p>

<h2>The simulation again</h2>
<p>Anyway, let’s do the whole simulation from the previous post again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)</code></pre>
<p>First enter the given information:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>labels &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Hispanic&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;), ordered=TRUE)

percentages &lt;- c(72, 7, 12, 9)
names(percentages) &lt;- labels

observed &lt;- c(205, 26, 25, 19)
names(observed) &lt;- labels</code></pre>
<p>Calculate the expected frequencies and the observed <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>expected &lt;- 275*percentages/100

observed_chi_square &lt;- sum((observed - expected)^2/expected)
observed_chi_square</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.88961</code></pre>
<p>Repeatedly sample, with replacement, 275 pieces of paper from a bag
representing the population, tally each sample, and record the frequencies in a
data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bag &lt;- rep(labels, percentages)
do(1000) * tally(sample(bag, 275, replace=TRUE)) -&gt; selections
glimpse(selections)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Observations: 1,000
## Variables: 4
## $ White    &lt;int&gt; 206, 190, 189, 196, 201, 190, 201, 203, 201, 195, 195, …
## $ Black    &lt;int&gt; 14, 19, 17, 20, 19, 28, 23, 17, 24, 23, 17, 19, 17, 14,…
## $ Hispanic &lt;int&gt; 36, 35, 36, 35, 27, 27, 24, 30, 28, 20, 28, 28, 35, 33,…
## $ Other    &lt;int&gt; 19, 31, 33, 24, 28, 30, 27, 25, 22, 37, 35, 42, 25, 26,…</code></pre>
<p>Add a new column to the data set, with the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores of the simulated samples:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = pmap_dbl(., ~sum((c(...) - expected)^2/expected))) -&gt;
    selections_with_chisq</code></pre>
<p>This is what we have now:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(selections_with_chisq)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   White Black Hispanic Other     chisq
## 1   206    14       36    19 3.3636364
## 2   190    19       35    31 2.0259740
## 3   189    17       36    33 3.6948052
## 4   196    20       35    24 0.1933622
## 5   201    19       27    28 1.5663781
## 6   190    28       27    30 6.5050505</code></pre>
<p>Plot the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores of all the simulated samples, and mark the
observed <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> on the plot with a vertical line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_histogram(~chisq, data = selections_with_chisq) %&gt;%
    gf_vline(xintercept = observed_chi_square, color=&quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-04-30-rows-in-tidyverse-again_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>How many of the 1000 simulated samples had a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score greater than or equal to the observed <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>count(~(chisq &gt;= observed_chi_square), data = selections_with_chisq)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## n_TRUE 
##    132</code></pre>

<div id="possible-simplification" class="section level2">
<h2>Possible simplification</h2>
<p>I am pretty happy with this. The only thing that I think can still confuse R
beginners is the use of <code>.</code> as the first argument of <code>pmap_dbl</code>. I usually do
few examples of <em>tidyverse</em> pipelines at the beginning of the semester, and
usually one or two of those use this somewhere, but I don’t think most students
will remember those at this point. Since we do not actually need to preserve
the original columns (the only reason I preserved them was to make the data set
look just like a worksheet they filled in while figuring out the whole idea of
<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores), we can do this instead:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;% 
    pmap_df(~list(chisq = sum((c(...) - expected)^2/expected))) -&gt; chisquares</code></pre>
<p>and then replace <code>selections_with_chisq</code> by <code>chisquares</code> when making the
histogram and calculating the p-value. I am not sure if this really is that
much simpler, with the <code>list</code>, and <code>pmap_df</code> not being one of the basic <em>dplyr</em>
verbs we learned at the beginning of the semester…</p>
