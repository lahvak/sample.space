      <description>So I am grading intro algebra exams, and there is this problem:
The product of two consecutive positive even integers in 168. Find the integers.
Students are supposed to solve this by setting up and solving a quadratic equation \(x(x+2) = 168\). Whatâ€™s stupid about this is that at this moment the only way to solve this equation that the students know is simple factoring, so they have to rewrite the equation as \(x^2 + 2x - 168 = 0\) and factor it.</description>
