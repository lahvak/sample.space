      <description>For many years, our department has been organizing an annual math competition for local high school students, called imaginatively Math Olympics. Over time it went through a number of format changes, the current one being a 25 question multiple choice exam, with two different levels of difficulty. Students fill in Scantron bubble sheets, which are then scanned using a machine. Because of our specific scoring process, we do not use the scoring software that comes with the machine.</description>
