      <description>This blog uses utterance.es to enable commenting on posts. Utterances use GitHub issues to keep track of commens. Basically the way it works is, when you comment, an issue will be created on GitHub with your comment. Utterances then finds all issues related to a post, and displays them as comments at the bottom of the post.
This makes it easy for me, because all your comments are available to me on GitHub, where I can easily access and manage them.</description>

      <description>I was sitting on this for few years now, using it as an example in a couple of seminar talks, but not really doing anything with it. It seems like a good candidate for a first post on my new blog.
