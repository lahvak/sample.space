      <description>In the last post I complained that there is no way to apply a formula to rows of a data frame so that the formula will consume the rows as lists or vectors. Turns out I was wrong, and there is a very easy way to do it!
Not only that, but I was actually really close to it, and if I was just reading the relevant documentation bit more carefullyâ€¦</description>

      <description>This has been bothering me for a while: is there a good simple way to apply a formula to rows of a data frame or table, where the formula would consume the rows as vectors?
Update: There is actually a very simple way to do it. See the next post.
Motivation The section 3.3 of the Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation contains the following example:
 In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county.</description>

      <description>This blog uses utterance.es to enable commenting on posts. Utterances use GitHub issues to keep track of commens. Basically the way it works is, when you comment, an issue will be created on GitHub with your comment. Utterances then finds all issues related to a post, and displays them as comments at the bottom of the post.
This makes it easy for me, because all your comments are available to me on GitHub, where I can easily access and manage them.</description>

      <description>I was sitting on this for few years now, using it as an example in a couple of seminar talks, but not really doing anything with it. It seems like a good candidate for a first post on my new blog.
Complex Domain Coloring A long time ago I ran across a website created by Frank Farris and Jeffrey Hoffstein, that showed some awesome images of automorphic functions created using a method for visualizing complex functions of complex variable called Complex Domain Coloring.</description>
