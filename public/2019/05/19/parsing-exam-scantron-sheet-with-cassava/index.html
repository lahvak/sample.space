  <h1> Parsing Exam Scantron Sheets with Cassava </h1>

  <div class="entry-content">
    


<p>For many years, our department has been organizing an annual math competition
for local high school students, called imaginatively <a href="https://www.svsu.edu/matholympics/">Math
Olympics</a>. Over time it went through a
number of format changes, the current one being a 25 question multiple choice
exam, with two different levels of difficulty. Students fill in Scantron bubble
sheets, which are then scanned using a machine. Because of our specific
scoring process, we do not use the scoring software that comes with the
machine. Instead, we take the data file that comes from the machine, and run
it through our own scoring program. Currently this program is a 13 years old
Python 2 script, that has been modified extensively during the years.</p>
<p>Recently, we switched to a new model of Scantron machines, that produce comma
separated files instead of the raw text files that the old machines created.
While it was easy to modify the Python script to parse the new format, the new
machine provide some new options that we would like to take an advantage of.
In particular, with the new data format, students can fill in several bubbles
for each question. In the old format, this would be marked as an error by the
machine, but the new machine tells us exactly which bubbles were filled in.
That gives us the possibility to use questions that have several correct
answers, and either accept any of them as correct, or require that students
mark all the correct options in their answer. That would, however, require
some significant changes to the scoring script, and at this moment, it may
actually be a good option to rewrite the script from scratch. I have decided
to try to write the new scorer in Haskell instead of Python.</p>
<div id="the-data-format" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data Format:</h2>
<p>Each record in the csv file consists of 202 columns: the student name, ID
number, and 200 answers. The student name has 74 uppercase letters or spaces
(the actual field on the sheet is only 20 characters long, the machine appends
54 spaces to it), the ID field has 32 spaces of digits (again, the actual fiels
for ID on the scantron sheet is only 7 characters long, this time the machine
prepends 25 spaces before the ID for some reason). Each of the 200 answer
columns seem to contain one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the text “BLANK”, when the answer was left blank,</li>
<li>one of the letters A, B, C, D, or E, when only one bubble was filled,</li>
<li>comma separated list of letters in parentheses, when several bubbles were
filled, for example “(A,B,D)”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will represent each record as</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>data Sheet = 
    Sheet
        { name :: !Text
        , id :: !Text
        , answers :: [Set Option]
        }
        deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>Option</code> type is given by</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>data Option = A | B | C | D | E | Invalid deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)</code></pre>
<p>with one option for each of the 5 possible letter, and an <code>Invalid</code> option just
in case something unexpected shows up.</p>
</div>
<div id="cassava-library" class="section level2">
<h2>Cassava library</h2>
<p>There are couple of options for csv parsing with Haskell. I decided to use the
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cassava">Cassava library</a>, which has nice
easy to use interface and good documentation. There is even a <a href="https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/csv-encoding-decoding/">nice
tutorial</a>.
There were still some things that I had to figure out, though. All the
examples and tutorials seem to deal with csv files that have 3 or 4 columns.
Ours has 202 columns. Also, I wanted to use the same parsing library to deal
with the answers of the “(A,B,C)” form, which turned out to be surprisingly
easy. One great thing about Haskell is that a lot of stuff can be figured out
simply by looking at type signatures.</p>
</div>
<div id="parsing" class="section level2">
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<div id="ghc-extensions" class="section level3">
<h3>GHC extensions</h3>
<p>We will use couple of GHC extensions to make things easier:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}</code></pre>
<p>Cassava uses ByteStrings to represent input, and the <code>OverloadedStrings</code>
extension will make it possible to compare ByteStrings to String literals.</p>
<p>Since each individual answer is represented as <code>Set Option</code>, to be able to
parse them, we will have to make <code>Set Option</code> an instance of FromField type
class. <code>FlexibleInstances</code> will make that possible without having to wrap <code>Set Option</code> in another specialized type.</p>
</div>
<div id="imports" class="section level3">
<h3>Imports</h3>
<p>First of all we will obviously need some imports from the Cassava library:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>import Data.Csv
  ( FromRecord(parseRecord)
  , FromField(parseField)
  , decode
  , HasHeader(NoHeader)
  , (.!)
  )</code></pre>
<p>We will use Text to represent both the student name and the ID, so we will need
<code>Data.Text</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.Text as Text</code></pre>
<p>The input data is represented using ByteStrings. All the actual characters
will be printable ASCII symbols (actually only uppercase letters, digits,
spaces and few symbols such as <code>*</code> and parentheses), so to make manipulation
easier, we will use <code>Data.ByteString.Char8</code>, which will give us ByteString
version of bunch of string functions. We will also need some version of
<code>isSpace</code> to filter out unwanted spaces.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BS
import Data.Char (isSpace)</code></pre>
<p>Obviously we will need <code>Set</code>. After Cassava breaks a record into fields, it
keeps it as a Vector of ByteStrings. Since we will need to manipulate that a
bit, we will need <code>Data.Vector</code>. Also, the parsed file will be represented as
a vector of <code>Sheet</code>s.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>-- Set
import Data.Set (Set)
import qualified Data.Set as Set

-- Vector
import Data.Vector (Vector)
import qualified Data.Vector as Vector</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need <code>mzero</code> for parsing failure.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>import Control.Monad (mzero)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="parsing-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>Now we can actually define the types to represent the sheets:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>data Option = A | B | C | D | E | Invalid deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

data Sheet = 
    Sheet
        { name :: !Text
          , id :: !Text
          , answers :: [Set Option]
        }
        deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>We need to teach Cassava how to parse the <code>Option</code> type, as well as the <code>Set Option</code>. To do that, we declare <code>Option</code> and <code>Set Option</code> (with
<code>FlexibleInstances</code>) to be of type class <code>FromField</code>. We need to implement a
single function</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>parseField :: Field -&gt; Parser a</code></pre>
<p>where <code>Field</code> is a synonym for ByteString.</p>
<p>For <code>Option</code>, this is very easy: each of the valid letters gets parsed as the
corresponding option, and everything else is <code>Invalid</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>instance FromField Option where
    parseField s
      | s == &quot;A&quot; = pure A
      | s == &quot;B&quot; = pure B
      | s == &quot;C&quot; = pure C
      | s == &quot;D&quot; = pure D
      | s == &quot;E&quot; = pure E
      | otherwise = pure Invalid</code></pre>
<p>For <code>Set Option</code>, the parsing basically follows the three possible cases that
can be in an answer column. The file generated by the machine does not contain
any extra spaces, but technically the csv file can contain extra spaces after
commas and perhaps at other places. Just to make sure, we will just simply
filter all spaces out. Then we will cover the three cases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The answer is “BLANK”. That should be parsed as an empty set. It does not
look like there will ever be an actually empty field, but just in case, that
should be handled the same way as “BLANK”.</p></li>
<li><p>The answer is a single letter. This should be parsed as a set containing a
single option.</p></li>
<li><p>The answer is a set of several letters. We already know that the input
has more than 1 character, otherwise it would get handled by one of the first two cases,
so we can safely use <code>head</code> and <code>last</code>. We can
check if the head is <code>(</code> and last <code>)</code>, in which case we strip these off,
split the remaining part at commas, and parse the resulting list as
<code>Option</code>s.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing else should ever come up, but if something does anyway, we need to
decide what to do. We can use <code>mzero</code> that would fail the parsing, but I
don’t think that is what we want to do. Any unexpected result here
would probably mean the sheet was really messed up, in which case we should
just ignore it. Let’s make it the same as a single invalid answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="haskell"><code>instance FromField (Set Option) where
    parseField r
      | BS.length s == 0 || s == &quot;BLANK&quot; = pure Set.empty
      | BS.length s == 1 = Set.singleton &lt;$&gt; parseField s
      | BS.head s == &#39;(&#39; &amp;&amp; BS.last s == &#39;)&#39; = 
          Set.fromList &lt;$&gt; 
             traverse parseField ( BS.split &#39;,&#39; . BS.init . BS.tail $ s)
      | otherwise = pure $ Set.singleton Invalid
      where s = BS.filter (not . isSpace) r</code></pre>
<p>Now we have to put together a parser for the whole record. We need to make our <code>Sheet</code> type
an instance of <code>FromRecord</code>. For that, we need to implement the function</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>parseRecord :: Record -&gt; Parser a</code></pre>
<p>where <code>Record</code> is a synonym for <code>Vector Field</code> and <code>a</code> is <code>Sheet</code>.</p>
<p>If the record has at least two fields, we will assume the first is the name,
and the second is the ID. We will strip leading and trailing spaces from the
name, and take only the last 7 characters from ID. Then the rest of the fields
should be answers. We will use the fact that <code>[a]</code> is an instance of
<code>FromRecord</code> if <code>a</code> has type class <code>FromField</code>. Since we made <code>Set Option</code> an
instance of <code>FromField</code>, we can get <code>Parser [Set Option]</code> simply by applying
<code>parseRecord</code> on the vector of remaining fields, after dropping the name and ID
fields.</p>
<p>If the record has less than two fields, we simply use <code>mzero</code> to signal parsing
failure.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>instance FromRecord Sheet where
    parseRecord v
        | length v &gt;= 2 = Sheet &lt;$&gt; 
            (Text.strip &lt;$&gt; v .! 0) &lt;*&gt; 
                (Text.takeEnd 7 &lt;$&gt; v .! 1) &lt;*&gt;
                    parseRecord (Vector.drop 2 v)
        | otherwise = mzero</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! Now we are able to parse the csv files generated by our Scantron
machine.</p>
<p>For the actual Math Olympics exams, we add <code>Vector.take 25</code> call after the <code>Vector.drop 2 v</code>, because we know we only have 25 questions.</p>
</div>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Let’s look at several quick examples of how this works. First we will define a
function <code>decodeRec</code> that, when given a ByteString, will attempt to parse it as
a Scantron sheet. First we will need to add</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>import Data.ByteString.Lazy</code></pre>
<p>to the import section of our file. Then define</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>decodeRec :: Data.ByteString.Lazy.ByteString -&gt; Either String (Vector Sheet)
decodeRec = decode NoHeader</code></pre>
<p>We get the following results:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>decodeRec &quot;MARTY BLOOM       ,          2345678,A, A ,B,C,D,C,E,C,E,C,A,B,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D,D&quot;</code></pre>
