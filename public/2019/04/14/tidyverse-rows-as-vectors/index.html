<p>This has been bothering me for a while: is there a good simple way to apply a
formula to rows of a data frame or table, where the formula would consume the
rows as vectors?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There is actually a very simple way to do it. See <a href="https://space.lahvak.space/2019/04/30/rows-in-tidyverse-again/">the next post</a>.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The section 3.3 of the <a href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs">Introductory Statistics with Randomization and
Simulation</a>
contains the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a
small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in
the table below, and we would like
to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If
the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the
sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors,
i.e. registered voters.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Race:</th>
<th align="center">White</th>
<th align="center">Black</th>
<th align="center">Hispanic</th>
<th align="center">Other</th>
<th align="center">Total</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Representation in juries:</td>
<td align="center">205</td>
<td align="center">26</td>
<td align="center">25</td>
<td align="center">19</td>
<td align="center">275</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Registered voters:</td>
<td align="center">0.72</td>
<td align="center">0.07</td>
<td align="center">0.12</td>
<td align="center">0.09</td>
<td align="center">1.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population
proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that
the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled
from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance.
However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the
juries were not representative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the book has the words “Randomization and Simulation” in the title, it
does not talk about simulation for a goodness of fit test. Instead, it jumps
straight into calculating <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score, and then brings in the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>
distribution and goes on to find the p-value estimate from the table that is in
the back of the book. This is, however, very easy to simulate. There is just
one step that I wish was a bit simpler.</p>
</div>
<div id="simulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>We will make one basic assumption to make the simulation simpler: we will
assume that the county, although small, is nevertheless large enough so that
when we select a sample of size 275, the selections can be considered
independent.</p>
<p>The question we are trying to answer here is: <em>how would the samples look like
if the jurors really were selected completely randomly from the population?</em> We
can easily get an answer to that by taking a bag with 100 pieces of paper, 72
of them labeled <em>White</em>, 7 labeled <em>Black</em>, 12 labeled <em>Hispanic</em> and 9 labeled
<em>Other</em>. This bag will simulate the county population. Then we randomly sample
275 pieces of paper with replacement (since we assume that the individual
selections can be considered independent).</p>
<p>A lot of very easy simulations of this type in R can be done with the <code>mosaic</code>
package. In class I usually start with two level factor variables (single
proportion), simulated either by sampling from a bag or using a loaded coin.
We will also use the <code>tidyverse</code>: first we will want <code>forcats</code> to make creating
an ordered factor easier, and later we will use more <code>tidyverse</code> packages to
analyze the results of the simulation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)</code></pre>
<p>We need to prepare a “bag” from which we will sample. There are several ways
to do this. For example, we can start by creating a list of labels to use. It
is important to create the labels as an ordered factor, so later as we simulate
the sampling, things will be always kept in the same predictable order.</p>
<p>In plain R, creating an ordered factor with a specific order requires a bit of
a boilerplate, but the <code>forcats</code> package makes this much easier. The only
thing that I find puzzling is that a function that is specifically designed for
creating factors with a specific order has an <code>ordered</code> parameter that defaults
to <code>FALSE</code>. Consistency … hobgoblin …. I mean, one of the great things
about the <code>tidyverse</code> is that unlike functions in base R, that are, as they say
in my country, “each dog different village”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the tidyverse functions have a
consistent interface, but this seems to be going a bit too far.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>labels &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Hispanic&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;), ordered=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>We will also need a table of percentages that describe the population from
which we sample. We can use the labels as names for the list entries, just to
keep things a bit more organized.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>percentages &lt;- c(72, 7, 12, 9)
names(percentages) &lt;- labels
percentages</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    White    Black Hispanic    Other 
##       72        7       12        9</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to create the bag that will represent the county population,
from which we will sample. We could also simply sample directly from the
<code>labels</code> variable, and use the <code>percentages</code> to specify the probability of each
of the labels, but let’s try to simulate the sampling from a bag with pieces of
paper as closely as possible.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bag &lt;- rep(labels, percentages)
bag</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   [1] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##   [8] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [15] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [22] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [29] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [36] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [43] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [50] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [57] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [64] White    White    White    White    White    White    White   
##  [71] White    White    Black    Black    Black    Black    Black   
##  [78] Black    Black    Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic
##  [85] Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic Hispanic
##  [92] Other    Other    Other    Other    Other    Other    Other   
##  [99] Other    Other   
## Levels: White &lt; Black &lt; Hispanic &lt; Other</code></pre>
<p>Now we can sample from the bag. Sample 275 pieces of paper with replacement,
and tally the results:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tally(sample(bag, 275, replace=TRUE))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## X
##    White    Black Hispanic    Other 
##      208       18       30       19</code></pre>
<p>This is an example how the juror distribution could look like if the jurors
were selected randomly.</p>
<p>Now we want to repeat this many times, and collect the results. The <code>mosaic</code>
package makes this really easy:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>do(1000) * tally(sample(bag, 275, replace=TRUE)) -&gt; selections
glimpse(selections)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Observations: 1,000
## Variables: 4
## $ White    &lt;int&gt; 190, 195, 202, 193, 192, 202, 206, 199, 202, 206, 206, …
## $ Black    &lt;int&gt; 27, 25, 23, 18, 18, 15, 22, 14, 22, 15, 9, 21, 26, 17, …
## $ Hispanic &lt;int&gt; 33, 21, 32, 38, 37, 37, 32, 37, 26, 31, 35, 32, 34, 29,…
## $ Other    &lt;int&gt; 25, 34, 18, 26, 28, 21, 15, 25, 25, 23, 25, 28, 27, 19,…</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, each row of the <code>selection</code> data set is a summary of a simple
random sample of size 275 from the simulated population. We can perhaps see it
better when looking at the first few rows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(selections)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   White Black Hispanic Other
## 1   190    27       33    25
## 2   195    25       21    34
## 3   202    23       32    18
## 4   193    18       38    26
## 5   192    18       37    28
## 6   202    15       37    21</code></pre>

<div id="chi2-scores" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores</h2>
<p>Now that we have a large number of samples that are randomly selected from the
given population, we need some way to compare the observed sample with all
these simulated samples. We want to find some way to rank each sample, that
will tell us <em>how far</em> each sample is from an ideal sample that has exactly
the same proportions of each category as the population itself.</p>
<p>This is usually done with so called <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores. For each category, we want
to compare the frequency of that category in the sample with the expected
frequency of the category. Since each category has different expected
frequency, the distributions of the frequencies will be different. To be able
to safely combine and compare the frequencies in different categories, we need
to divide the difference between the sample frequency and the expected
frequency by the standard deviation, which, in this case, can be calculated as
the square root of the expected frequency. That means we actually calculate the
z-score of each sample frequency.</p>
<p>To combine the z-scores for all categories together, we need to make them
non-negative, and then add them together. For the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>-score, we make them
non-negative by squaring them, so the score is then calculated as
<span class="math display">\[\chi^2 = \sum \frac{\left(\text{sample frequency} - \text{expected frequency}\right)^2}{\text{expected frequency}}\]</span>
Let’s start by calculating the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score of the observed sample. To start
with we need to find the expected frequencies. The sample size is 275, and the
population percentages for each category we already entered:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>percentages</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    White    Black Hispanic    Other 
##       72        7       12        9</code></pre>
<p>The expected frequencies will then be</p>
<pre class="r"><code>expected &lt;- 275*percentages/100
expected</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    White    Black Hispanic    Other 
##   198.00    19.25    33.00    24.75</code></pre>
<p>We also need to enter the frequencies of the observed sample:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed &lt;- c(205, 26, 25, 19)
names(observed) &lt;- labels
observed</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    White    Black Hispanic    Other 
##      205       26       25       19</code></pre>
<p>Then the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score of the observed sample is simply</p>
<pre class="r"><code>observed_chi_square &lt;- sum((observed - expected)^2/expected)
observed_chi_square</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.88961</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to do the same calculation for each of the simulated samples. This
is where things get complicated.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would just map the formula over the data set, row wise. However, I
was not able to find a way to do this. A logical place to look at would be the
<a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</a> package. It does provide some ways of
mapping a formula over rows, however, as far as I can tell, none of them will
let me use rows as vectors. From the description it would seem like <code>pmap</code>
should do it, but I was unable to make it work, and none of the examples that I
found on the web seem to apply to this situation. It seems that there is no
way to use the whole row as a vector in <code>pmap</code>. As far as I can tell, you
need to specifically enter each of the arguments in <code>pmap</code>, using numbered
codes like <code>..1</code>, <code>..2</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>I can do for example this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = pmap_dbl(., ~sum((c(..1, ..2, ..3, ..4) -
                                 expected)^2/expected))) %&gt;%
    head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   White Black Hispanic Other    chisq
## 1   190    27       33    25 3.445887
## 2   195    25       21    34 9.583694
## 3   202    23       32    18 2.682540
## 4   193    18       38    26 1.028139
## 5   192    18       37    28 1.174603
## 6   202    15       37    21 2.072150</code></pre>
<p>which is fairly close to what I am looking for, but the <code>c(..1, ..2, ..3, ..4)</code>
will quickly get unwieldy and error prone with larger number of categories.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to do something like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmap_dbl(selections, ~sum((.row - expected)^2/expected))</code></pre>
<p>but there does not seem to be any way to do this.</p>
<p>One way is to <em>transpose</em> the data frame - it is way easier to map things over
columns than over rows. This will work nicely:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = transpose(.) %&gt;%
           simplify_all() %&gt;%
           map_dbl(~sum((.x - expected)^2/expected))) %&gt;%
    head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   White Black Hispanic Other    chisq
## 1   190    27       33    25 3.445887
## 2   195    25       21    34 9.583694
## 3   202    23       32    18 2.682540
## 4   193    18       38    26 1.028139
## 5   192    18       37    28 1.174603
## 6   202    15       37    21 2.072150</code></pre>
<p>or, equivalently,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = transpose(.) %&gt;%
           map_dbl(~sum((as_vector(.x) - expected)^2/expected))) %&gt;%
    head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   White Black Hispanic Other    chisq
## 1   190    27       33    25 3.445887
## 2   195    25       21    34 9.583694
## 3   202    23       32    18 2.682540
## 4   193    18       38    26 1.028139
## 5   192    18       37    28 1.174603
## 6   202    15       37    21 2.072150</code></pre>
<p>The problems I have with this approach are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It requires a “nested” pipe (or a mess of nested parentheses which is something
that students learning R for the first time have trouble with).</li>
<li>It introduces two additional concepts (transposition and either <code>simplify_all</code>
or <code>as_vector</code>) that have nothing to do with the already pretty complicated
topic of goodness of fit test.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="finishing-the-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Finishing the test</h2>
<p>Let’s quickly finish the comparison of the observed sample frequencies with the
simulated sample frequencies. First, let’s actually use one of the less than
ideal ways to calculate the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selections %&gt;%
    mutate(chisq = transpose(.) %&gt;%
           map_dbl(~sum((as_vector(.x) - expected)^2/expected))) -&gt;
    selections_with_chisq</code></pre>
<p>Then we plot the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> scores of all the simulated samples, and mark the
observed <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> on the plot with a vertical line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_histogram(~chisq, data = selections_with_chisq) %&gt;%
    gf_vline(xintercept = observed_chi_square, color=&quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="../../../../post/2019-04-14-tidyverse-rows-as-vectors_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can then easily answer the question “how many of the 1000 simulated samples
had a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score greater than or equal to the observed <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> score?”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>count(~(chisq &gt;= observed_chi_square), data = selections_with_chisq)</code></pre>

##    124</code></pre>
